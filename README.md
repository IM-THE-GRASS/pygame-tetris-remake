# pygame tetris remake




A very shitty tetris remake made in Pygame 



### How to run:
To run and for developmentyou need python 3.11 or above[^1] 
in terminal, navigate to the repository folder and run 

`python -m pip install -r /requirements.txt`

to run just write `python main.py` in the command line



[^1]:version 3.11 or above is fine, older versions may work but I haven't tested them
